This directory contains the script used for extracting the OCR'd text from the American Trade Indexes for 1906 and 1913 -- i.e., the membership directories of the National Association of manufacturers. The script is not perfect, it requires manual postprocessing to clean up, but it does OK. 

The script *removeduplicates.py* in the directory *genericscripts* was further used to process the resulting 1906 and 1913 lists to obtain the file *companies_1906_1913_marked_formap* which was used to create the Google Fusion map located here: http://bit.ly/nammap

More to come, hopefully.
